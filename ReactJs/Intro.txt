React Js

-> React is a Frontend Library , used for Frontend application development
-> react will use extremely good level of javascript to change the content of the page and this is only the concept of Virtual DOM
-> Whatever logic we r going to write on react is going to be executed on virtual DOM
and then this virtual DOM will be like a layer to Real DOM with the help of which websites are modified
-> It doesnt reload the static website it happens dynamically


Role Of React in MVC (Model View Controller): -
MVC is a backend terminology used in the world of backend
in backend there is a thing called model , view and controller 
MVC pattern was used in those web d applications which contain the same Frontend and backend structure (on the same application)
Model - is the schema of database table (what type of objects(or class) you want to create in your backend application)
View - Views are mostly the html or Frontend part of backend+Frontend application
Controller - is the API (main part of backend application) it deal with requests and model
but today we dont follow MVC pattern , today frontend is different 
so we have  Model and controllers


Now , How to create React application using npm and npx 
npx is mostly used on windows (so use both npm and npx)
on mac and linux -> npm 

Create react app on system:-
npx create-react-app my-app  // create-react-app is external library helps you to create react app on your system
cd my-app
npm start


What is Babel ? 
React uses Advanced javascript and our browser many times does not understands 
babel is a library/external dependency which converts to slightly lower level js so browser can understands


Component in React:- (either it can be a function or it can be a class)
It is a piece of JSX(kind of html) that can be used in multiple places
-> a component (function or class) is reusable piece of code

-> every html element is a react element also 
-> we can also create cutomised tag in react 


React Reconciliation:-
-> when we change the state of the component , react will re-render the component
-> react will compare the previous state of the component with the new state of the component

//Otimised way of rendering the component
-> we should give a seperate unique key to each element in react (so that react can easily identify the element and can easily compare the previous state with the new state)

CSS IN REACT : - (only two ways)
-> we can use inline css in react
-> we can use external css in react
-> internal css is not used in react

-> Module is a bigger component which have multiple components together 
which works together for single purpose


PROP IN REACT : - (it is a way to pass data from parent to child)
